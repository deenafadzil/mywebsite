        I started my studies in primary schools in Kuala Lumpur. It is a fun memory where I do not have to think about anything rather than exams. I enjoyed myself during that time. I succeeded in getting 5A for UPSR and 6A 1B for my UPSRA. I believe that I did a great job!

        Then, I further my studies in secondary schools. I went to boarding school. In this school, we are required to memorize the Quran. It is a tough journey for me as I am not mentally prepared and expect that I need to memorize the Quran. I really thought that the schools is like a normal islamic schools where it teach us more about Islam.  However, for PT3 I succeed to get 8A and getting B for Tahfiz curriculum subject.

        <br>
        After PT3 I got an offer to further my studies in MRSM. I think it is a great opportunity for me. During those 2 years, there are a lot of things that I learned . For example, being independent as the distance between my home and MRSM is quite far, so I need to take a bus to go home. For SPM I succeeded in getting 5A and 3B.

        After SPM, I have pursued my studies in certificates in graphic design. Here, I managed to develop my soft skills in graphic design. I study by using authoring software such Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe in Design. It is a good experience and valuable experience as I believe that those skills really help me during my studies in university.

        <br>
        In 2020, I got an offer to UiTM Kampus Rembau majoring in Diploma Information Management. During my studies I have achieved a good result. I managed to get a dean 's list for every semester with my CGPA 3.94. I do hope that my interest and dreams in being a librarian can be achieved. In hope I could change people's mindset, and our community towards librarians.
